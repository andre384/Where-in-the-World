# Where-in-the-World

This notebook explores possible ways to calculate the angle of the sun in the sky and also uses this information to determine a location on Earth. 
Trigonomety is used heavily in this notebook for the simple reason of calculating angles. If you dont have a GPS, no problem. Just bring a compass and a calculator.
